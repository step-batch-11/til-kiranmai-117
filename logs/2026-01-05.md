# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What _clicked_ today?
  - generating sinewaves with noise.
  - pipeing input/output streams.
- ## What changed in your understanding?
  - prompt() is just a function and it works different from how stdin readable
    works.
  - readable is an iterator.
- ## What would you explain differently now?

---

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
  - how the prompt() function works.
- What would you like to see one more example of?
  - experiment on streams.
- ## What feels fragile in your understanding?

---

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- which buffer the prompt() will look for ?
- how the streams get locked ?
- how pipeTo() and pipeThrough() function works ?
- what are the perameters to textEncoder and textDecoder ?

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- A REPL experiment
- A minimal snippet
- A variation of today’s code

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> Today was useful because i got to knew about streams.
